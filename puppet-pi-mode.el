;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Puppet ( http://www.puppetlabs.com/ ) provides command line documentation
;; reference tool called `pi' from version 0.25.
;; puppet-pi-mode enable you to query `type' documentation from emacs buffer.
;; 
;; Tested on Emacs 22

;;; Customizable Options:
;; 
;; if you don't want select pi-buffer , set below
;; (setq puppet-pi-disable-select-window t)
;;

;;; Sample config:
;; 
;; (require 'puppet-pi-mode)
;; (add-hook 'puppet-mode-hook
;; 		  (lambda ()
;; 			(local-set-key "\C-c\C-d" 'puppet-pi-query)))
;; 
;; then you can search pi from emacs puppet-mode buffer with C-cC-d.
;;

;;; Todo:
;; Setup pi query keywords from the resoult of 'pi --list'.
;; Cache the result of pi query.

;;; Code:
